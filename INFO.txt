Description: 
 Triplexator investigates the potential of two sequences to engage in
 nucleic acid triple-helix formation with each other.
 .
 Triplexator runs in different modes depending on the supplied input. 
 If one sequence set is provided that acts as the putative third strand
 Triplexator searches for putative triplex-forming oligonucleotides in 
 this set. Conversely, putative triplex-target sites are detected if a 
 sequence set providing the duplex is input. In case both kinds of sequences
 are input Triplexator will search for putative TFO-TTS pairs (triple-helices)
 between these sequences, i.e. matches between the triplex-forming 
 oligonucleotides of the single-stranded set and the triplex target sites of 
 the duplex set.
