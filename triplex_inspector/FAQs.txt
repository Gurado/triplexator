1) Google Chrome won't show my data:

	This is a security policy when accessing files locally via "file://" rather than via "http://"
	A workaround is to run chrome allowing file-access.
	
	Disclaimer: this should only been done to browse the result file generated by Triplex-Inspector and NOT to browse the web as it otherwise constitutes a security risk.

	Windows:
	chrome.exe --allow-file-access-from-files

	MacOS X: start chrome from command line with:
	/Applications/Google\ Chrome.app/Contents/MacOS/Google\ Chrome --allow-file-access-from-files &> /dev/null &
	
	Alternatively, switch to firefox, safari or fire up a local webserver and access the result files via "http://" 

2) Opera won't show my data:
	
	same as for Google's chrome this is a security policy that can be disabled by typing the following into the browser address field:
	
	opera:config#UserPrefs|AllowFileXMLHttpRequest
	
	and then setting the tick at the checkbox next to "Allow File XMLHttpRequest" and saving the preferences
	
	Alternatively, switch to firefox, safari or fire up a local webserver and access the result files via "http://" 	

3) Internet Explorer does funny things:

	Triplex inspector has not been developed for and/or tested on internet explorer.
	We recommend you switch to Firefox or Safari.
