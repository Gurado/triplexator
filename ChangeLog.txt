2013-03-31 Fabian Buske		v1.3.2
	Help messages shortened
	Parameters Change: Filtering set to Brute-Force by default
	Bugfix: Detection of parallel environments
	Compiler warnings resolved
	Switch to serial processing in case number of processors is 1
	GCC 4.7 support added

2012-11-12 Fabian Buske		v1.3.1
	Bugfix: Variable initialization

2012-07-06  Fabian Buske	v1.3.0
	Updated repeat finder directives to seqan rev 12251
	Migrated to cmake for cross platform compatibility and packaging
	Incorporated triplex-inspector v0.1.0

2012-05-30  Fabian Buske	v1.2.1
	Updated repeat finder directives to seqan rev 11739
	Updated alphabet directives to seqan rev 11739

2012-01-05  Fabian Buske	v1.2.0
	Added feature: maximum guanine rate for targets can be specified (--max_guanine)
	Refactoring: percent-guanine parameter changed to --min_guanine
	Added feature: Output now also shows the guanine-rate of the triplex feature
	Bugfix: perform parallel tts detection if requested (--runtime-mode 2)
	Added feature: triplex potential is now an accurate calculation rather than approximation
	Added feature: triplex potential is now computed by default, option --normalized-score is obsolete and therefore removed
	Refactoring: maximum triplex feature length parameter (short) changed from "-u" to "-L"
	Default changed: maximum triplex feature length set to 30 by default (from unrestricted)
	Refactoring: output.h and triplex.h merged

2011-11-28  Fabian Buske	v1.1.2
	Updated parallel processing directives to seqan rev 10701
	Updated repeat finder directives to seqan rev 10701
	Added feature: all-matches : process and report all sub-matches in addition to the longest match
	Added feature: min-block-run : run of consecutive matches of a given length that a feature must contain to quality
	Added feature: merge-fetures : allows to collapse overlapping features and reports cluster regions instead individual features
	Refactoring: disentangle the triplexator application from the triplex template files
	Added feature: errors/mismatches are now correspond to a user selectable reference point (parameter -re)
	Added feature: maximum and minimum guanine percentage in GT motif triplexes can be used to specify whether such a feature qualifies for parallel or anti-parallel oriented binding 

2011-09-01  Fabian Buske	v1.1.1
	Bugfix with respect to q-gram filtering (maximal error taken into account when calculating the seed thresholds)

	Default error-rate adjusted to 5%
	Minimum guanine rate adjusted to 10%
	Q-gram weight set to maximum of 14 nt.
	Allow user to specify whether to compute the length-normalised triplex potential
	Bugfix that affected a small proportion of predicted targets when guanine rate is set > 0
	Allow user to specify maximum feature length.

	Crop sequence ids of single-stranded sequences at first whitespace
	Fixed but for TFO/TTS-naming in output when run in triplex search mode
	Replaced deprecated MultiFasta class with MultiSeqFile


2011-08-11  Fabian Buske	v1.0.1
	Fixed bug in duplex processing
	Adjusted log output to report relevant parameters only
	Fixed bug in Makefiles
